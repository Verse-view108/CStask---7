What I Have Learned – Attacks Possible Using Browser Extensions

- Malicious extensions can read everything I type (passwords, credit cards, messages)  
- They can steal login cookies and take over my accounts without the password  
- They can silently take screenshots of any website I visit (banking, email, etc.)  
- They can change what I see on websites (inject fake login forms, fake bank pages)  
- They can redirect my searches and clicks to earn money or spread malware  
- They can record my entire browsing history and sell it  
- They can use my PC to mine cryptocurrency in the background (high CPU/electricity)  
- They can install additional malware or ransomware  
- Even one bad extension with “Read and change all your data on all websites” permission can do all of the above  

Key lesson: Never install extensions from unknown sources and always check permissions.
